And now, I will turn the call over to David.  --  Thank you, Olivia, and good morning. Welcome to the first earnings call for Office Properties Income Trust, which is the culmination of the merger between Government Properties Income Trust and Select Income REIT. On today's call, I will provide an overview of OPI and an update on our capital recycling program before turning the call over to Jeff Leer to provide an overview of financial results. Before I begin, I would like to highlight that due to the merger closing on the last business day of the quarter, fourth quarter results reflect a combined balance sheet, but only GOV's operating results. To help rectify this, we provided pro form consolidated results as if the merger had closed on October 1st, instead of December 31st in our earnings release and supplemental disclosure package. Our operating strategy for OPI will differ from our operating strategies for GOV and SIR as stand-alone companies. One material difference will be our plan to actively recycle capital through asset sales at OPI, first to manage leverage, but ongoing to shape the portfolio. In doing so, we expect to reduce the average age of our properties, increase our weighted average remaining lease term and to reduce future capital requirements. Another strategy shift will be to focus on favoring the acquisition of first-generation buildings. We believe this will increase the likelihood of tenants renewing leases, which should have a positive impact on OPI's occupancy and reduce ongoing leasing capital. These two strategies are expected to create long-term cash flow accretion and contribute to maintaining a well covered dividends. Entering 2019, OPI has a broader investment strategy to foster growth and is a Company with increased scale and greater diversification. We believe, we have reduced risk at OPI by lowering our concentration of US government tenants, increasing geographic diversification, lengthening our weighted-average remaining lease term, creating a more well-laddered lease expiration schedule and reducing our exposure to floating rate debt. We have also increased the side of our Board, adding two independent trustees, which increases the number of female trustees to 38% and the total number of independent trustees to 75%. On December 31st 2018, OPI's portfolio consisted of 247 buildings containing 31.9 million square feet, that were 91% occupied with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5.7 years and an average building age of approximately 17 years. 64.9% of our annualized rent is paid by investment grade rated tenants, which we believe is one of the highest percentages of rent paid by investment grade rated tenants in the office REIT sector. The US government is our largest tenant, accounting for 25.6% of annualized rent, this is a reduction from 45.6% pre-merger and no other tenant accounts for more than 2.7% of annualized rent. We've also reduced the percentage of leases expiring, through the end of 2021 from 47.4% of annualized rent pre-merger to 27% at the end of the quarter. OPI's investment strategy will focus on office, properties and markets to have strong economic fundamentals to support growth, and will include properties leased to single-tenant and multi-tenant properties leased to high credit quality tenants like government entities. Key criteria for acquiring single-tenant properties will include the evaluation of how strategic the property is to the tenants business, focusing on corporate headquarters, build-to-suit properties and buildings where the tenants have invested meaningful capital. Single-tenant building acquisitions will also include a minimum remaining lease term of seven years. Properties leased to government tenants will include both single-tenant and multi-tenant buildings, and we'll focus on agencies that have high security needs or a mission that is strategic to the building's location. We expect to acquire, primarily, first generation buildings, where there is a reasonably high probability of renewing the tenant in place and were ongoing capital needs are expected to be relatively modest compared to older buildings. Turning to our capital recycling. In addition to initially selling properties to reduce leverage, we plan to have an ongoing capital recycling program of $100 million to $300 million annually to shape our key portfolio metrics and to manage ongoing capital requirements. As a reminder, we recently announced the completion of the sale of 34 buildings in the Metro DC market for gross proceeds of $198.5 million. This completed the disposition plan associated with our acquisition of First Potomac Realty Trust in the fourth quarter of 2017. In aggregate, we sold $520 million of properties to permanently financed the acquisition. Today OPI has 36 buildings in a disposition plan to permanently finance our merger with SIR. Two of these properties are under agreement to sell for approximately $77 million in gross proceeds and the balance of the buildings are in various stages of marketing. In aggregate, we are selling approximately 5.9 million square feet of buildings that we believe will generate more than $750 million in gross proceeds. Considering our progress on this disposition plan, since completing the merger, we remain confident that OPI will substantially complete the sale of these properties before announcing second quarter earnings. This will position the Company to comfortably reenter the acquisition market in the second half of 2019, while continuing to shape the portfolio with a capital recycling program. In summary, we are excited about the opportunities available to OPI as a stronger Company with greater scale and financial flexibility, we are all -- we also look forward to executing on our capital recycling plan in returning to growth in the second half of 2019. I will now turn the call over to Jeff to provide an overview of financial results.  --  Thanks, David. To begin I just want to reiterate that due to the merger of GOV and SIR closing on December 31st 2018, in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from SIR in the merger are included in OPI's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31st 2018. However, SIR's results of operations are excluded from OPI's actual historical consolidated statements income for all periods. OPI's fourth quarter financial results were impacted by certain non-recurring items, which were related to an unrealized non-cash loss of $42 million from OPI's investment in The RMR Group Inc, a non-cash loss of $18.7 million on the sale of SIR shares in Q4, and $10.7 million related to the transaction cost associated with the merger. These items were partially offset by the reversal of GOV's previously accrued business management incentive fee expense of $17 million. As a result of the timing of the merger and the impact of overall results, I plan to focus the remainder of this discussion covering Q4 2018 pro forma results, as if the merger had occurred on October 1st 2018. Pro forma normalized funds from operations would have been $49.6 million, or $1.03 per share for the quarter, and includes a $25.8 million business management incentive fee incurred by SIR, as of December 31st 2018, that was subsequently paid by OPI. Our first, second and third quarter's normalized FFO calculation, exclude accrued business management incentive fees and are included in the fourth quarter, when the amounts are determined. As a reminder, the ending share price used to calculate the total return for the incentive fee is the highest 10 consecutive day average closing price over the final 30 days of the measurement period. Pro forma consolidated cash basis, net operating income or cash basis NOI would have been $119.9 million for the fourth quarter. On a pro forma same property basis, cash basis NOI would have been $97.1 million, which equated to an increase of approximately $500,000 or 0.5% as compared to the same period of the previous year, which is primarily driven by higher rents in the legacy SIR portfolio. Excluding the net impact of business management incentive fees, our pro forma run rate for G&A expense is expected to be within a range of $10 million to $12 million per quarter. On a pro forma basis, capital expenditures would have been $25.6 million of which $12.5 million related to recurring building improvements, and $13.1 million was attributable to tenant improvements and leasing cost. As of the quarter end, we have approximately $58.4 million of unspent leasing-related capital obligations. Pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA was approximately 7.6 times. However, when including the debt repayment from the $198.5 million of asset sales that closed in February 2019, our debt to adjusted EBITDA would have been 7.2 times. As we begin to execute on our disposition strategy to delever the portfolio, we expect to achieve our target debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to be between 6 times to 7 times by the second half of 2019 by using proceeds from our target asset sales pay off our floating rate debt and current fixed rate debt obligations that are due in 2019. As a reminder, in January, we declared quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share. This rate is approximate 75% of our expected cash available for distribution for 2019, a level which is expected to provide us with greater financial flexibility and the ability to increase the dividend over time. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're ready to open the call up for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operators Instructions) The first question comes from Bryan Maher with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.  --  Yeah, good morning guys. When it comes to CapEx, I think you mentioned $25.6 million with $12.5 million recurring and $13 million tenant improvements, what should we be thinking about for the combined entity for the full year, as it relates to CapEx?  --  Brian, that's a good question. I guess what I would tell you is, we expect to lease about 1.5 million square feet of space during 2019. And we think that the average leasing capital per square foot is going to be around $2.65 per square foot.  --  Okay.  --  And then in addition for building capital, we have a range of approximately $60 million to $80 million in building capital.  --  Did you say $60 million to $80 million.  --  Correct.  --  And that would be just recurring regular CapEx for the portfolio.  --  Correct.  --  Okay. Moving on to your lease renewal rates, that you reported. Just to be clear, I think it was like down 7.8% below prior rents for those properties that had renewals for the fourth quarter. To be clear, that was just GOV or was that GOV and SIR?  --  That was just GOV. But with that said, Bryan, I think we only have one lease renewal at SIR, and it was small. So it would not have had a material impact.  --  And as you look out to 2019 and I'm not really sure you want to give this number, but directionally in magnitude wise, what should we be thinking about for lease renewal rates?  --  Well, we think that both new and renewal leases for 2019 will be roughly flat compared to leases in place today.  --  Okay, great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then just lastly, after you get done with the -- I think in the press release I saw, like a $700 million number of the new sales and on your prepared comments you said $750 million, is it closer to $700 million or $750 million in sales?  --  The expected sales for 2019, we expect to exceed $750 million.  --  Okay. And then just to be clear, after this current round of sales as we look at kind of the back half of 2019 and 2020, other than the $100 million to $300 million of capital recycling, you are pretty much done with dispositions, is that correct?  --  Well, I think the important thing Bryan, is the focus on the fact that we expect to have an ongoing capital recycling program. The -- more than $750 million of dispositions for 2019 will rightsize our leverage, beyond that it becomes a portfolio shaping exercise and an opportunity to create CAD accretion through dispositions.  --  Right. That's what I said, after the $750 million, it's pretty much $100 million to $300 million on a regular basis. But no other material, portfolio, dispositions or I would expect in the near-term meaningful acquisitions, is that the way to think about it?  --  Yes. We expect to be back in the acquisition game in the second half of 2019, so we'll see how the market looks in the second half of the year.  --  Okay. Thanks, that's all for me. Okay. (Operator instruction) The next question comes from Adam Gabalski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  --  Hey, guys. This is Adam on for Vikram. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the plan dispositions. Are you guys going to be selling stabilized assets? And I'm just trying to get a sense of what this $700 million to $750 million in dispositions is going to mean for portfolio occupancy, once it's completed?  --  Well, Adam, it's a good question, Adam. Well, I think what I would tell you on that is, we ended the year at 91% occupancy, we expect occupancy to be in the fourth quarter of 2019 about 91.5%. We expect it to get higher than that throughout the year, but then kind of reduce to 91.5% by the end of the year. The average occupancy of the buildings that we are selling is just under 80% because it includes a handful of vacant properties to include a large land parcel that's vacant.  --  Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just one more, as far as the dividend moving forward, in the merger document you guys outlined a 75% target CAD payout ratio. Just now that the portfolio is integrated. Do you guys see that as sort of an achievable target moving forward with the way you've set the dividend out of the gate?  --  Yes, we specifically set the dividend -- or the dividend we declared in January was based upon what we expect to be around a 75% CAD payout ratio for 2019.  --  Got it. Thank you. Okay. Seeing no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Blackman for any closing remarks.  --  Great, thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter activity in a couple of months. That concludes our call. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.  --   --   --   --   --  Transcript powered by
